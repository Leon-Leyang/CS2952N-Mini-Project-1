# CS2952N-Mini-Project-1
This is the first mini project of CS 2952-N Spring 2023. The project is about multimodal learning.



### Step 1

**Task1:** *Perform zero-shot image classification with CLIP on CIFAR-10. You only need to pick 500 random examples from the validation / test set of CIFAR-10.*

**Task2:** *Perform linear probing with CLIP on CIFAR-10. You need to extract CLIP image embeddings for 1000 random examples from the training set of CIFAR-10, then train a linear classifier. Report classification accuracy on the same 500 random test examples as in Task 1.*



Run 'Step1.py', you'll get a **zero shot accuracy** of **71.60%** and a **linear probing accuracy** of **79.60%** .
